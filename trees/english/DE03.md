Note-taking is very important <u>in</u> accurate reporting. Reporting is when you tell <u>someone</u> what <u>happened</u> or what someone <u>said</u>. Taking <u>notes</u> helps you remember the details <u>of</u> what you heard <u>or</u> saw. When you have notes, you can look at them later to remember what happened.

Success is not as important as determination. Even if you fail, you should <u>aim</u> to work your <u>hardest</u> to <u>solve</u> a <u>problem</u>. In the end, that <u>skill</u> will take you <u>farther</u> than <u>succeeding</u> at <u>everything</u> you <u>face</u>. Success often requires some luck, but determination and hard work are within your control.
